# Quit Smoking Cigarrette and D3


Everyone knows that cigarette consumption is bad for human health... but what about the age? do you feel that it's "too late"? Let's check this data!

This website it's dedicated to support people who smoke and to help them to quit. The information is based on U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for 2014 ACS 1-year estimates [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml)

As Data Visualization lover, you'll see a scatter plot with the correlation of Smokers vs. Age, for which I used D3, together with tooltips to show labels in each circle of the scatter. `d3-tip.js` plugin was developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/Caged). Another inspiration for this was [David Gotz's example](https://bl.ocks.org/davegotz/bd54b56723c154d25eedde6504d30ad7) to see how implement tooltips with d3-tip.


* To run this code: Please use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.


Enjoy the ride

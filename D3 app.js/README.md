# Quit Smoking Cigarrette and D3


Have you ever felt that it's too late to quit smoking cigars? Guess what: it's never too late!

This website it's dedicated to support people who smoke and to help them to quit. The information is based on [U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) for 2014 ACS 1-year estimates.

As Data Visualization lover, you'll see a scatter plot with the correlation of `Smokers vs. Age`. This combines D3 and tooltips to show labels in each circle of the scatter. `d3-tip.js` plugin was developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/Caged). Another inspiration for this was [David Gotz's example](https://bl.ocks.org/davegotz/bd54b56723c154d25eedde6504d30ad7) to see how implement tooltips with d3-tip.


* To run this code: Please use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

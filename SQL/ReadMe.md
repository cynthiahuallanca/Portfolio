Hi!

The Sakila Database sample was designed as a replacement to the world sample database, also provided by Oracle. [See the complete story here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-history.html) 


Using MySQL [version 5.7](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.7.html) you'll see different approaches to obtain helpful information for **sales, marketing campaigns and more!** Follow the comments to check the goal of each code and as always, if you have any comment don't hesitate in contacting me.

Enjoy the ride!

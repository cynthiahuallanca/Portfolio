Hi!

The Sakila Database sample was designed as a replacement to the world sample database, also provided by Oracle. [See the complete story here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-history.html) 

Inside you'll see different approaches to obtain helpfull information for sales, marketing campaigns and more! Follow the comments to check the goal of each code and as always, if you ave any comment don't esitate in contacting me. 

Enjoy the ride!

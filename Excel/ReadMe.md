## Background

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, 
but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it 
through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months 
looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. 


#Summary 
The database has four thousand past projects that after some analizis we can uncover hidden trends.

# Some key methods used here are: 
* Conditional formatting for campaign status
* Pivot table to analyze initial worksheet 
* Pivot chart line graph
* Report in Microsoft Word to answer: 

1. What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?
2. What are some of the limitations of this dataset?
3. What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?
